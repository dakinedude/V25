{f(h(x, y)) = h(x, x)}

assume that:
weight(f(x)) = 3 + weight(x)
weight(h(x, y)) = 2 + weight(x) + weight(y)
weight(a) = 1, for all constants a

weight(f(h(x, y)))
= 3 + weight(h(x,y))
= 2 + 3 + weight(x) + weight(y)
> 2 + weight(x) + weight(x)
= weight(h(x,x))

Since the lefthand side weights more than
the righthand side, the system terminates
