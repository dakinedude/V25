1. x ** 0 = s(0)
2. x ** s(y) = x * (x ** y)

1. **(x, 0) = s(0)
lpo2: ** > s
**(x, 0) > 0 holds from lpo1: 0 = 0

2. **(x, s(y)) = *(x, **(x, y))
lpo2: ** > *
**(x, s(y)) > x holds from lpo1
**(x, s(y)) > **(x, y)
compare lexocraphically:
(x, s(y)) > (x, y) holds
**(x, s(y)) > y holds from lpo1:
s(y) > y, because y = y.
