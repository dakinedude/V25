Proving that the weight function for
{f(f(x)) = f(g(f(x)))}
that assigns weight based on "the number of adj. f's"
is not monotonic:

Assume that weight(f(f(x))) = 1

Assume that the weight function is monotonic.

That means that f(t) > f(u), if t > u.

Thus the system clearly terminates, due to the lh side
having one pair of adj. f's.

f(f(f(x))) > f(f(g(f(x)))) should hold, in adherence to
the assumption.

weight(f(f(f(x))))
= 1 + weight(f(x))

weight f(f(g(f(x))))
= 1 + weight(g(f(x)))
= 1 + weight(f(x))

We thus have obtained a contradiction, following the assumption
that the weight function is question, is monotonic.

Thus, it cannot be monotonic.
