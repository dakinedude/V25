Assume the spec:

{f(s(x), x, x) = f(x, f(s(x), x, x), s(x))}

w/o the cond., the spec would hold, due to the lex.comp

(s(x), x, x) > (x, f(s(x), x, x), s(x)) holding.

However, f(s(x), x, x) > f(s(x), x, x) does NOT hold,
because > is a strict partial order.

We need this condition to ensure that the recursive positions
are increasing; we cannot simply rely on decreasing lexicographic order.
