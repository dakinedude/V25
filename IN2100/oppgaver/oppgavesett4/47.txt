1.
g(x) does not match h(g(a)), because there is no substitution S
for x such that g(xS) = h(g(a)). Matching is done to variables.

2. f(x,x) matches not f(a, b). x can only be substituted with one
variable. It does not match f(a,z)

3. Yes. S = {x-> g(a), y-> g(a)}

4. Two, both the first and second subterms are matched (x goes to a)

5. Yes

x -> s(0 + s(0)) , y-> 0

x -> 0 , y -> s(0)

6. No, and comm. does not matter, because matching only takes
the position of the subterms into account. Thus position 1.1 != 1.2.
